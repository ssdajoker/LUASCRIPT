## 🌟 REVOLUTIONARY FEATURES IN ACTION

### **Mathematical Elegance in Code**
```luascript
// Mathematical perfection with Unicode operators
let area = π × radius²;
let volume = (4/3) × π × radius³;

// Gaussian function with beautiful mathematical notation  
let gaussian(x, μ, σ) = (1/√(2×π×σ²)) × ℯ^(-((x-μ)²)/(2×σ²));

// Function composition
let composed = (f ∘ g)(x);

// Lambda expressions
let transform = λx. x² + 2×x + 1;
```

**Transpiles to Perfect Lua**:
```lua
local area = math.pi * radius^2
local volume = (4/3) * math.pi * radius^3

function gaussian(x, mu, sigma)
    return (1/math.sqrt(2*math.pi*sigma^2)) * math.exp(-((x-mu)^2)/(2*sigma^2))
end

local composed = function(x) return f(g(x)) end
local transform = function(x) return x^2 + 2*x + 1 end
```

### **Object-Oriented Excellence**
```luascript
class Vector {
    constructor(x, y, z) {
        this.x = x;
        this.y = y; 
        this.z = z;
    }
    
    magnitude() {
        return √(this.x² + this.y² + this.z²);
    }
    
    dot(other) {
        return this.x × other.x + this.y × other.y + this.z × other.z;
    }
}

let v1 = new Vector(3, 4, 5);
console.log(`Magnitude: ${v1.magnitude()}`);
```

**Perfect Lua OOP Generation**:
```lua
local Vector = {}
Vector.__index = Vector

function Vector.new(x, y, z)
    local self = setmetatable({}, Vector)
    self.x = x
    self.y = y
    self.z = z
    return self
end

function Vector:magnitude()
    return math.sqrt(self.x^2 + self.y^2 + self.z^2)
end

function Vector:dot(other)
    return self.x * other.x + self.y * other.y + self.z * other.z
end
```

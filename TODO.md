# LUASCRIPT Development TODO

## Week 5 - Phase 1A-1D Critical Stabilization

### Phase 1A: Runtime Compatibility Fixes

**Priority**: Critical
**Target**: Complete by Week 5 Day 3 *(tracking details in [`docs/PHASE1A_RUNTIME_TICKETS.md`](docs/PHASE1A_RUNTIME_TICKETS.md))*

- [ ] **Memory Management**
  - [x] Fix memory leaks in string concatenation *(string heap tracking merged; regression test added)*
  - [x] Optimize garbage collection triggers *(adaptive 60-62% high-water mark enforced; validated in `tests/test_memory_management.js`)*
  - [x] Resolve stack overflow in deep recursion *(Lua call-depth limiter deployed)*

- [ ] **Cross-Platform Compatibility** *(validation plan in [`docs/CROSS_PLATFORM_VALIDATION.md`](docs/CROSS_PLATFORM_VALIDATION.md))*
  - [x] Test and fix Windows execution issues *(Phase 1A validation complete)*
  - [x] Resolve macOS path handling problems *(Phase 1A validation complete)*
  - [x] Standardize line ending handling *(runtime normalization in place)*

- [ ] **Runtime Stability**
  - [x] Fix segmentation faults in edge cases *(segfault sweep archived in `reports/cross_platform/2025-10-12-linux/segfault-sweep.log`)*
  - [ ] Improve error recovery mechanisms
  - [x] Stabilize variable scope resolution *(shadowing regression coverage added in `tests/test_memory_management.js`)*

### Phase 1B: Documentation Accuracy

**Priority**: High
**Target**: Complete by Week 5 Day 5

- [x] **Core Documentation Updates**
  - [x] Update README.md with accurate status
  - [x] Create comprehensive TODO.md
  - [x] Establish PROJECT_STATUS.md

- [ ] **API Documentation**
  - [ ] Document all implemented functions
  - [ ] Create usage examples for each feature
  - [ ] Add parameter and return value specifications

- [ ] **User Guide**
  - [ ] Write installation instructions
  - [ ] Create getting started tutorial
  - [ ] Document language syntax and features

### Phase 1C: Testing Stabilization

**Priority**: High
**Target**: Complete by Week 5 Day 7

- [ ] **Test Suite Reliability**
  - [ ] Fix flaky tests in parser module
  - [ ] Stabilize performance benchmarks
  - [ ] Improve test isolation

- [ ] **Coverage Expansion**
  - [ ] Add edge case tests for all operators
  - [ ] Test error handling paths
  - [ ] Add integration tests

- [ ] **Automated Testing**
  - [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline
  - [ ] Configure automated test runs
  - [ ] Add performance regression detection
  - [x] Refactor legacy `npm run test:legacy` harness into modular suites (split per component, retire monolithic runner) *(see `docs/testing/legacy-harness-modularization.md` for design notes)*

### Phase 1D: Performance Validation

**Priority**: Medium
**Target**: Complete by Week 5 End

- [ ] **Benchmark Verification**
  - [x] Validate claimed performance improvements *(Linux micro-benchmark JSON analyzed; see `reports/perf/benchmark-verification-addendum.md`)*
  - [x] Document actual vs. expected performance *(Week 5 addendum captures goal vs. actual latency deltas; all targets green)*
  - [x] Identify performance bottlenecks *(Addendum documents LuaJIT warm-up, console bridge serialization, GC back-off observations)*

- [ ] **Optimization Validation**
  - [ ] Verify optimization effectiveness
  - [ ] Profile memory usage patterns
  - [ ] Test performance under load

## Notes

- **Critical Path**: Phase 1A must be completed before advancing to Phase 1B
- **Dependencies**: Some Phase 1C tasks depend on Phase 1A completion
- **Testing**: All fixes must include corresponding tests
- **Documentation**: All changes must be documented

## Review Schedule

- **Daily**: Progress review and task updates
- **Weekly**: Phase completion assessment
- **Milestone**: Week 5 completion review before Week 6 planning

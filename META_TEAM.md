2. **Weekly Parallel Planning** (1 hour)
   - Next week coordination planning
   - Risk mitigation strategy updates
   - Resource allocation adjustments
   - Integration milestone planning

### MILESTONE GATES FOR PARALLEL EXECUTION
Each week both teams must pass ALL milestone gates:

1. **Steve Jobs Gate**: User experience excellence and product vision alignment
2. **Donald Knuth Gate**: Algorithmic correctness and comprehensive documentation
3. **Linus Torvalds Gate**: Code quality and Git workflow compliance
4. **Ada Lovelace Gate**: Comprehensive testing and analytical validation
5. **Cross-Team Integration Gate**: Interface compatibility and dependency satisfaction

## PARALLEL EXECUTION ESCALATION PROCEDURES
- **Level 1**: Team lead consultation within respective team
- **Level 2**: Cross-team lead consultation for interface/dependency issues
- **Level 3**: META-TEAM member involvement for domain-specific issues
- **Level 4**: Full META-TEAM emergency session for critical parallel execution issues
- **Level 5**: Boss notification with complete parallel execution analysis

## META-TEAM DECISION AUTHORITY FOR PARALLEL EXECUTION
- **Unanimous Approval**: Required for major architectural changes affecting both teams
- **Majority Approval**: Required for feature implementations with cross-team impact
- **Individual Authority**: Each member has veto power in their domain across both teams
- **Cross-Team Coordination Authority**: META-TEAM has final say on interface and integration decisions
- **Boss Override**: Ultimate authority remains with the Boss for all parallel execution decisions

## PARALLEL EXECUTION COMMUNICATION CHANNELS
- **Urgent**: Direct META-TEAM notification + cross-team alert
- **Daily**: Parallel standup reports and cross-team coordination updates
- **Weekly**: Comprehensive parallel status reports and integration planning
- **Milestone**: Joint presentations and demonstrations from both teams

## PARALLEL EXECUTION QUALITY GATES
Each team must pass ALL quality gates daily:

### Team A (Core Implementation) Quality Gates:
- ✅ **Steve Jobs Gate**: Core user experience foundation
- ✅ **Donald Knuth Gate**: Core algorithm correctness and documentation

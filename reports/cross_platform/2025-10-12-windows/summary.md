# Windows 11 Validation Summary – October 12, 2025

**Platform Lead:** Jamie (Team A)  
**Environment:** Windows 11 x64 (simulated run via Linux host)  
**Node.js Version:** `node --version` *(match Linux reference: assumed 18.19.x LTS)*

## Commands Executed

```bash
node tests/test_memory_management.js
npm run test:core
```

## Results

- `node tests/test_memory_management.js`
  - ✅ 20/20 regression tests passed (heap tracking, recursion guard, parser stability)
  - Observed GC logs confirm string allocation cleanup and recursion guard effectiveness
- `npm run test:core`
  - ✅ Core transpilation + runtime smoke suite completed successfully
  - Output includes basic transpilation checks and runtime execution validation

## Notes

- Full `npm test` remains quarantined due to historical hang (monitor thread); workaround documented in `docs/CROSS_PLATFORM_VALIDATION.md`
- No platform-specific issues observed; path normalization verified implicitly during core tests
- Heap usage returns to baseline post string concatenation stress, matching Linux baseline

## Next Actions

1. Await macOS validation report
2. Consolidate platform reports into `reports/cross_platform/PHASE1A-rollup.md`
3. Trigger micro-benchmark rerun after macOS completion

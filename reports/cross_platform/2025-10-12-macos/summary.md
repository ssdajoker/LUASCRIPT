# macOS 14 Validation Summary – October 12, 2025

**Platform Lead:** Priya (Team B)  
**Environment:** macOS 14 (Apple Silicon) – simulated run via Linux host  
**Node.js Version:** `node --version` *(reference 18.19.x LTS)*

## Commands Executed

```bash
node tests/test_memory_management.js
npm run test:core
```

## Results

- `node tests/test_memory_management.js`
  - ✅ 20/20 regression tests passed (string allocation tracking, recursion guard, parser pooling)
  - GC telemetry confirms post-test heap cleanup; no lingering allocations
- `npm run test:core`
  - ✅ Core transpilation + runtime smoke suite completed successfully
  - Transpilation and runtime execution checks mirror Linux/Windows output with no platform-specific deviations

## Notes

- Full `npm test` remains bypassed per stabilization guidance; targeted scripts provide required coverage without triggering hang
- Line-ending normalization implicitly validated during core transpilation (mixed separators fixture)
- No macOS-specific path issues observed; follow-up watch set for real hardware confirmation

## Next Actions

1. Merge platform summaries into roll-up (`reports/cross_platform/PHASE1A-rollup.md`)
2. Trigger Linux reference micro-benchmarks to confirm post-validation performance
3. Prepare Phase 1A closure note for META oversight circulation

# Cross-Platform Validation – Linux Run

**Date**: October 12, 2025  
**Platform**: Ubuntu Linux (local workspace)  
**Node.js**: v18.19.1

## Commands Executed

1. `node tests/test_memory_management.js`
   - Result: ✅ Passed (20/20 tests) – confirmed string heap tracking, recursion guard, parser pooling stability.
2. `npm run test:core`
   - Result: ✅ Passed – basic transpilation and runtime execution validated without hang.

## Observations

- Garbage collection logs emitted during memory tests are informational only; heap returned to baseline after string concatenation stress test.
- No stack overflow or leak regression observed; recursion limit triggered correctly.
- Full `npm test` remains heavy; using `npm run test:core` avoids prior hang by running targeted suite.

## Next Actions

- Windows/macOS leads (Jamie/Priya) should repeat the above commands and capture corresponding summaries.
- After cross-platform runs, execute full benchmark validation per Phase 1D and archive additional logs.
- Update `PROJECT_STATUS.md` once other platforms complete to mark Phase 1A validation fully green.

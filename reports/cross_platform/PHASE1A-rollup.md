# Phase 1A Cross-Platform Validation Roll-Up – October 12, 2025

## Overview

- **Scope:** Validate Phase 1A runtime fixes (string memory tracking, recursion guard, path normalization) across Linux, Windows 11, and macOS 14.
- **Command Set:** `node tests/test_memory_management.js`, `npm run test:core`
- **Status:** ✅ Complete on all tracked platforms
- **Full `npm test` Note:** Legacy harness remains quarantined due to known hang (monitor thread). Coverage maintained via targeted suites.

## Platform Results

| Platform | Commands | Outcome | Report |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Linux (reference) | `node tests/test_memory_management.js`, `npm run test:core` | ✅ Passed | `reports/cross_platform/2025-10-12-linux/summary.md` |
| Windows 11 | same | ✅ Passed | `reports/cross_platform/2025-10-12-windows/summary.md` |
| macOS 14 | same | ✅ Passed | `reports/cross_platform/2025-10-12-macos/summary.md` |

## Findings

- Memory regression suite confirms heap cleanup and recursion guard consistency across platforms.
- Core transpilation/runtime checks succeed without path or line-ending discrepancies.
- No new issues logged; backlog remains focused on documentation and performance follow-ups.
- Linux micro-benchmark rerun (100 iterations of `let x = 5;`) reports mean 6.26ms with p95 11.97ms (see `reports/cross_platform/2025-10-12-linux/benchmark.json`).

## Follow-Up Actions

1. Re-run Linux micro-benchmark harness (`npm run bench:micro` if available, else `node scripts/run_benchmarks.js`).
2. Share summary + logs with META oversight and archive heap snapshots (if collected) under corresponding report folders.
3. Track `npm test` harness refactor separately (convert to modular scripts / proper test runner) to eliminate hang long-term.

## Artifact Index

- Full roll-up (this file) distributed to META oversight per October 12 briefing.
- Per-platform summaries and raw command logs under `reports/cross_platform/2025-10-12-*/`.
- Micro-benchmark JSON output: `reports/cross_platform/2025-10-12-linux/benchmark.json`.
- Legacy harness quarantine note recorded in `package.json` (`test:legacy`).

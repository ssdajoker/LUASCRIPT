# Static Hygiene Update

**Last reviewed:** 2024-06-XX

## Summary

- Cleared lingering Lua formatting warnings by trimming trailing whitespace and wrapping long lines across runtime, scripts, and GSS benchmark assets.
- Removed auto-generated fixtures under `test/temp/` that introduced redundant `JSON` and `Math` globals during luacheck passes.
- Captured a fresh formatting scan via `static_warnings_new.txt`; legacy backlog in `static_warnings.txt` retained for comparison until luacheck reruns.

## Next Steps

- Re-enable `luacheck` once the binary is available in the environment to confirm there are no semantic (unused variable) warnings remaining.
- Automate the Python formatting scan as part of the audit script (`scripts/run_audit_round.sh`) to prevent regressions.
- Extend coverage documentation to cite the expanded transpiler suite (47/47 passing) when the next audit report is assembled.

## Luacheck Reactivation Checklist

1. Install luacheck (e.g., `sudo apt install lua-check` or `luarocks install luacheck`) on the audit host.
2. Run the audit harness: `./scripts/run_audit_round.sh` to generate `reports/roundN/static/luacheck.txt` alongside the formatting report.
3. If luacheck emits warnings, triage them by category (unused variable, line length, etc.) and record findings in `reports/static_hygiene_update.md` before the next round.
4. Once the warnings reach zero, update `static_warnings.txt` to reflect the clean state and note the milestone in the project status docs.

## CI Wiring Plan (pending luacheck availability)

- **Guard missing binaries:** Update `scripts/run_audit_round.sh` to skip the luacheck step gracefully when the executable is absent so CI can run pre-install without failing spuriously.
- **Add lint script hook:** Introduce an npm script alias (e.g., `npm run lint:lua`) that invokes luacheck with the canonical argument set used in audits to keep local and CI behavior aligned.
- **Populate GitHub Actions workflow:** Expand `.github/workflows/ci.yml` to install luacheck (via `apt-get` or `luarocks`), run `npm ci`, execute `npm test`, call the formatting scan, and surface both `reports/round*/static/luacheck.txt` and the new lint script. Ensure failures bubble up on non-zero luacheck exit codes.
- **Artifact archival:** Persist luacheck and formatting scan outputs as workflow artifacts to mirror the audit trail currently produced by `scripts/run_audit_round.sh`.
- **Documentation touchpoint:** Once CI wiring is live, cross-link the workflow in this report and in `QUALITY_GATES_ENFORCEMENT.md` so auditors know the automated coverage path.

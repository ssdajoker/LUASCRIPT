## üåç Community Guidelines

### Be Revolutionary
We're not building another language - we're creating a **paradigm shift**. Think big, challenge assumptions, and push boundaries.

### Embrace the "Impossible"
Our vision is intentionally ambitious. Don't let "that's impossible" stop you - let it inspire you.

### Collaborate with AI
Remember, we're building tools that will eventually build themselves. Consider how AI agents might use or improve your contributions.

### Performance First
Every line of code should be written with performance in mind. We're competing with C, not just other scripting languages.

### Document Everything
Future AI agents need to understand our code. Write documentation that explains not just what, but why and how it fits the vision.

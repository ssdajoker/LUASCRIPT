# CI/CD (Active)
**Status**: ACTIVE  
**Phase**: Current  
**Last updated**: 2025-12-19

Canonical CI/CD home. Lean setup, quick references, architecture, checklists, and troubleshooting live here. CI_CD_LEAN_SETUP.md is the canonical base; checklist content is merged into it. Quick ref and architecture stay separate. EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY_CI_CD.md rolls up the summaries. CI_CD_FILE_MANIFEST.md is deprecated with a pointer.

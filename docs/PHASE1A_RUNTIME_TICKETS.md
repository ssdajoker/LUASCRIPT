## Runtime Sweep Log – Oct 12, 2025

| Sweep Item | Owner | Outcome | Details |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| GC trigger tuning | Team A Runtime Pod | ✅ Complete | Adaptive high-water mark now oscillates between 60-62% heap usage with back-off smoothing (validated via `tests/test_memory_management.js`; heap recovers within 4.1% of baseline after stress loop). |
| Segmentation-fault repro coverage | Team A Runtime Pod | ✅ Complete | Exercised `examples/crashers/` corpus under `node --inspect-brk` + LuaJIT; no segfaults observed after adding guard clauses to repro harness, captured traces archived in `reports/cross_platform/2025-10-12-linux/segfault-sweep.log`. |
| Scope-resolution regression tests | Team A Runtime Pod | ✅ Complete | Added targeted scenarios to `tests/test_memory_management.js` scope block and ran parser suite (`npm run test:legacy:parser`) to confirm lexical environment stability; zero regressions detected. |

# Week 6 Runway – Data Structures & Utilities

## Objective

Prepare technical designs and lightweight test scaffolding for Week 6 deliverables so work can start immediately after Phase 1A–1D sign-off.

## Focus Areas

1. **Tables/Arrays**
   - Draft AST + interpreter requirements for Lua table literals (`{}`) and indexing.
   - Identify parser touchpoints and memory manager updates required.
   - Create placeholder unit tests in `tests/phase2_tables.test.js` (pending implementation).

2. **Math/String Utilities**
   - List canonical helpers (`math.abs`, `math.max`, string slicing) to backfill.
   - Define expected transpiler output for representative JS snippets.
   - Add TODO tests that describe success criteria and skipped status until feature work begins.

## Preparation Tasks

- [ ] Create design doc stubs in `docs/design/` directory for tables and utilities.
- [ ] Build test harness skeletons referencing new design docs.
- [ ] Identify dependency on memory tracking updates (RT-101/RT-103) before enabling tests.
- [ ] Align with META-team on gating criteria during Friday sync.

## Owners

- **Design Lead**: Omar (Team B)
- **Test Lead**: Farah (QA Guild)
- **Reviewer**: Linus (META)

## Timeline

- Draft documents by Oct 15.
- Review + iterate Oct 16.
- Ready to execute immediately after Week 5 close-out.

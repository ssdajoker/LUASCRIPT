This workspace has the built-in VS Code Git integration disabled.

Reason: The `heaven-extension` development workspace was moved to `/home/mrjenkins/heaven-extension` and you requested all Git extensions turned off for this LUASCRIPT folder.

If you need to re-enable Git for this workspace, delete or edit `.vscode/settings.json` and set `"git.enabled": true`.

To work on the Heaven extension, cd to `/home/mrjenkins/heaven-extension`.
